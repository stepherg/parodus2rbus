Description: Lightweight bridge translating Parodus-style JSON requests to RBUS
 parodus2rbus is a lightweight bridge that translates simple Parodus-style
 JSON requests into RBUS get/set operations. It supports Parodus transport
 via libparodus and handles WRP message types including REQ, RETRIEVE (CRUD
 read), and EVENT operations.
 .
 The application acts as a bridge between the Parodus WebPA protocol and
 the RBus messaging system, enabling communication between web-based
 configuration interfaces and device management systems.
